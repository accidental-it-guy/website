# **Preparing for WiCyS: What I’m Doing to Make the Most of the Conference**  

In just a few days, I’ll be attending my very first **WiCyS (Women in Cybersecurity) conference**, and I have a mix of excitement, nervousness, and a *mild* wardrobe crisis. (Seriously, what do people wear to these things? Business casual? Full hacker hoodie mode? Please send help.)  

Jokes aside, this is a huge milestone for me. Investing in myself and my future by attending **WiCyS** feels like a game-changer, and I want to make sure I get the most out of this experience. So, I’m sharing my prep process—both for myself and for anyone else who might be heading to their first cybersecurity conference!

## **Step 1: Setting My Goals for WiCyS**  

Since this is my **first WiCyS conference**, I know I need to go in with a plan. I don’t just want to wander from session to session feeling overwhelmed—I want to be intentional. Here’s what I’m focusing on:  

✅ **Learning from industry experts** – There are so many incredible talks and workshops, and I want to soak up as much knowledge as possible, especially on topics like **OSINT, incident response, and career transitions into cybersecurity.**  

✅ **Networking without awkwardness** – I won’t lie—even though I have a background in theatre, I’m an introvert in big crowds. But I also know that WiCyS is one of the best places to **connect with mentors, recruiters, and other women in cyber** who have been where I am. So, I’m pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone and **start real conversations.**  

✅ **Exploring career opportunities** – I’m still on my cybersecurity journey, but I know that WiCyS is a great place to **meet recruiters and hiring managers** from companies actively looking for talent. I want to get a feel for what roles might be a good fit for me and make some valuable connections.  

✅ **Having fun and enjoying the experience** – This is a celebration of how far I’ve come! I want to take it all in, **be present**, and remember that investing in myself was absolutely worth it.

## **Step 2: Planning My Conference Schedule**  

The WiCyS agenda is *stacked*, and I already know I can’t attend everything. (Whyyyyy are so many cool sessions at the same time?!?) So, I’m **strategically picking sessions** based on:  
📌 **Topics that align with my cybersecurity interests** (OSINT, threat intelligence, SOC roles, etc.)  
📌 **Workshops that offer hands-on learning** (because I learn best by doing!)  
📌 **Panels featuring women who inspire me** (representation matters, and I want to hear their stories)  

I’m also **leaving space for networking, breaks, and exploring**—because burnout is real, and I don’t want to be running from session to session without actually absorbing anything.

## **Step 3: Packing My Conference Essentials**  

Okay, real talk: I have **no idea what to wear.** I’ve read everything from “business casual” to “cyber hoodie chic” to “whatever makes you feel confident.” So my current plan is to pack **a mix of professional and comfortable outfits** and hope for the best. 😅  

Beyond clothes, here’s what’s going in my **WiCyS survival kit**:  

🎟 **Conference badge & schedule** (because I *will* get lost at least once)  
📱 **Portable charger** (WiCyS is a marathon, not a sprint)  
💻 **Notebook** (for taking notes and pretending to be ultra-organized)  
💼 **Resumes & business cards** (just in case I meet the perfect connection)  
🥤 **Water bottle & snacks** (because conference food lines are *long*)  

If you’re a **WiCyS veteran**, tell me: **What’s your go-to conference outfit?!**

## **Step 4: Networking Without the Awkwardness**  

Networking at big events can be *intimidating*, but I’m reminding myself that **WiCyS is built to be supportive and welcoming.** My plan:  

- **Join conversations naturally.** Instead of forcing awkward introductions, I’ll look for ways to engage in discussions happening around me.  
- **Use LinkedIn and Whova ahead of time.** I’ve been connecting with other attendees on Whova so we can meet up in person!  I’m already excited to meet up with other LGBTQIA+ folks for dinner =)
- **Have a simple introduction ready.** Something like:  
  > “Hey, I’m Liz! This is my first WiCyS conference, and I’m currently transitioning into cybersecurity from education. I’m especially interested in OSINT and incident response—how about you?”  

And try **not** to just word-vomit about astrology or how I'm growing tomatoes in my garden. (And yes, I’m fully prepared to practice this in the mirror before I go.)  

But let's be real: I'm gonna just have to lean into my awkwardness. Maybe it's endearing?

## **Step 5: Making the Most of WiCyS After It’s Over**  

A big mistake people make after conferences? **Not following up.** And I **know** I will have trouble with this one. So I’m setting aside time after WiCyS to:  

✔ **Connect on LinkedIn with people I meet**  
✔ **Send thank-you messages to speakers or recruiters I talk to**  
✔ **Review my notes & set action steps** (because knowledge without action is just trivia)  

I want to make sure this conference **keeps benefiting me long after it ends.**

## **Final Thoughts: Why Investing in Myself Was Worth It**  

As I pack my bags (and stress over my outfits), I’m feeling really grateful that I took this step for myself. **Investing in my career, my growth, and my future** isn’t always easy (or cheap)—but I know it’s worth it. **I** am worth it. 

If you’re going to WiCyS too, **let’s connect!** Drop a comment or message me—I’d love to meet fellow first-timers and share this experience. See you in Dallas! 🚀
